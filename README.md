# File Explorer

This is a mini file explorer (like Windows File Explorer). But with the extra feature you can create hard and soft links visually.

### About the Proyect

It was created using Visual Studio 2017 with no other tools or frameworks other than the native **winapi.dll**. You can open the _FileExplorer.sln_ with Visual Studio if you wish to edit the code.

Important note: to let some features work, you must _run as administrator._
